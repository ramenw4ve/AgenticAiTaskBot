  "Plan my day": [
    "Review your schedule for any fixed appointments or events throughout the day (e.g., work, meetings)",
    "Check local weather forecast to anticipate potential disruptions due to bad weather conditions such as rain or snow. This will help you adjust activities accordingly and allocate extra time if needed",
    "Assess your energy levels: Plan low-energy tasks during times when you typically feel less energetic (e.g., early mornings). Schedule high-energy tasks, like exercise, for a different part of the day",
    "Prioritize important or urgent activities that require more focus and concentration at peak mental energy levels such as afternoons or evenings in most individuals' case",
    "Include short breaks between long tasks to prevent burnout; these can be used for stretching, meditation, coffee break, etc., depending on personal preference. Breaks should ideally last about five minutes but could extend up to ten if needed. These are essential subtasks that will help maintain productivity throughout the day without overwhelming your energy levels",
    "Allocate time slots for meals and snacks; ensure enough food is available during working hours, especially when planning a long meeting or eventful days outdoor activities where you might not get an opportunity to eat on short notice",
    "Dedicate some downtime at the end of your workday: Engage in relaxing activities like reading, listening to music, taking a bath etc. before bedtime so that it becomes easier for you to fall asleep and wake up refreshed in the morning (which is important if having an early meeting or appointment)",
    "Remember personal commitments such as family time/meetings with friends outside work context \u2013 schedule these into your daily routine where possible, considering energy levels & fixed appointments earlier planned",
    "In case of any travels required throughout the day: Allocate ample time for commute and traffic; factor in buffer times if driving or when taking public transportation to ensure timely arrival at different locations without feeling rushed. Consider carpooling options, biking, walking as alternatives if possible while adhering safety measures like wearing masks during the pandemic (if applicable)",
    "Lastly, always leave some flexibility in your schedule for unexpected events or delays; this helps manage stress and gives a sense of control over unforeseen circumstances. Flexible blocks can also be used when feeling low on energy by swapping less essential tasks with more vital ones if needed without disrupting the overall structure too much (i.e., rescheduling personal errands instead changing work priorities)",
    "Remember to review your plan daily and adjust as necessary based on actual progress made, unexpected events or changes that may arise during each day's activities; this ensures continuous improvement in managing time effectively while still maintaining a healthy balance between productivity & leisurely moments throughout the week"
